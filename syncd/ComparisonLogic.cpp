 * @brief Process SAI object for ASIC view transition
 *
 * Purpose of this function is to find matching SAI object in current view
 * corresponding to new temporary view for which we want to make switch current
 * ASIC configuration.
 *
 * This function is recursive since it checks all object attributes including
 * attributes that contain other objects which at this stage may not be
 * processed yet.
 *
 * Processing may result in different actions:
 *
 * - no action is taken if objects are the same
 * - update existing object for new attributes if possible
 * - remove current object and create new object if updating current attributes
 *   is not possible or best matching object was not fount in current view
 *
 * All those actions will be generated "in memory" no actual SAI ASIC
 * operations will be performed at this stage.  After entire object dependency
 * graph will be processed and consistent, list of generated actions will be
 * executed on actual ASIC.  This approach is safer than making changes right
 * away since if some object is not supported we will return return but ASIC
 * still will be in consistent state.
 *
 * NOTE: Development is in progress, not all corner cases are supported yet.
 *
 * @param currentView Current view.
 * @param temporaryView Temporary view.
 * @param temporaryObj Temporary object to be processed.

     * be different then we can't just create temporary object because of key
     * will match and we have conflict, so we need first in this case remove
     * previous object with key
     *
     * so there are 2 options here:
     *
     * - either our finding best match function will always include matching
     *   keys (if more keys, they all should (or any?) match should be right
     *   away taken) and this should be only object returned on list possible
     *   candidates as best match then below logic should figure out that we
     *   cant do "set" and we need to destroy object and destroy it now, and
     *   create temporary later this means that finding best logic can return
     *   objects that are not upgradable "cant do set"
     *
     * - or second solution, in this case, finding best match will not include
     *   this object on list, since other create only attribute will be
     *   different which also means we need to destroy and recreate, but in
     *   this case finding best match will figure this out and will destroy
     *   object on the way since it will know that set transition is not
     *   possible so here when we find best match (other object) in that case
     *   we always will be able to do "SET", or when no object will be returned
     *   then we can just right away create this object since all keys objects
     *   were removed by finding best match
     *
     * In both cases logic is the same, someone needs to figure out whether
     * updating object and set is possible or whether we leave object alone, or
     * we delete it before creating new one object.
     *
     * Preferably this logic could be in both but that duplicates compare
     * actions i would rather want this in finding best match, but that would
     * modify current view which i don't like much and here it seems like to
     * much hassle since after finding best match here we would have simple

     * - queue - all other attributes can be set
     * - vlan - all other attributes can be set
